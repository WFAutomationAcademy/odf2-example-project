# ODF 2 Example Project

The ODF 2 example project is created to demonstrate key features of the framework. It contains four simple Business Processes that operate on a mock data model. While functional, these processes do not perform anything practically useful.

The project itself is not intended to be used as a template. To quickly create your project from scratch, use the [ODF 2 quickstart archetype](https://doc.workfusion.com/enterprise/docs/iac/core/user-guide/odf/odf2-simple-archetype/).
